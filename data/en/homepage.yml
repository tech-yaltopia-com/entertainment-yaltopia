  description : "“Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”  Dumbledore"
  content : "A friendship that spans decades, and still keeps on going. A bunch of guys that like computers, coding, designing, gaming, and movies. Bunch of guys who lose their temper here and there manifest in the abuse of keyboards and mouses mostly due to broken dreams (Journey to Plat).  As a group we always appreciated the fact that we were able to find each other to discuss about things we like in detail. That was the huge drive behind the creation of this platform, connect with us and other likeminded people here."
